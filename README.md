### Running the Project:
To run the project, change the API key in the code to your own API key.
Specifically, change the "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE" with your real API key.

There are two places that you need to modify in the CatListFragment.kt file:
- In the populateSpinner function
- In the setupSpinnerListener function
